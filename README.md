Demo for implementing a simple CI/CD pipeline at AWS EC2 using Ansible|Jenkins|Docker. This includes creation of Jenkins instance as well using Ansible Playbook.



**Steps to be followed:**

- Deploy 2 EC2 instances (Ansible+Jenkins & WebServer)
- Deploy Playbooks to set up each of the above
- Create Pipeline in Jenkins*
- Deploy the simple-website from `https://github.com/BINPIPE/simple-website` via the simple pipeline.

*For the pipeline we have tried out 3 different modes- Freestyle with Shell snippet, Scripted & a Free-style with Ansible plug-in. Follow the video for details on implementation.

Once comfortable you can add it up with steps like Sonarscan, Monitoring & using Declarative pipelines later on. You can also try containerising the Website using Docker and deploy it using Docker containers!
